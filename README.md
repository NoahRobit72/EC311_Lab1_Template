# Lab 1: Design 4-bit binary Adder-Subtractor and ALU
## Due Date: Due by October 14, 2022

Please submit the lab on time and in the format mentioned below.

## Submission instructions
There are two main parts in lab-1: 1) Designing a 4-bit adder/subtractor; 2) Designing a 4-bit ALU.

### Folders Structure
There are following 2 folders in the main folder ("EC311_Lab1_Template"):
  - (1) "add_sub_4_bit"
  - (2) "alu_4_bit"
  
You will place the solution code for part-1 of lab-1, i.e., the 4-bit binary adder-subtractor in the folder named "add_sub_4_bit", and the solution code for part-2 of lab-1, i.e., the 4-bit Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU) in the folder named "alu_4_bit".

### Lab-1 Part-1 Folder Structure & Signal Naming
The main solution code for the part-1 of lab-1 should be inside the file in the following path:
- *EC311_Lab1_Template/add_sub_4_bit/add_sub_4_bit.v*

Do not changed the names of the output ports or the module name for your top file.


### Lab-1 Part-2 Folder Structure & Signal Naming
The main solution verilog code for the part-2 of lab-1 should be inside the file in the following path:
- *EC311_Lab1_Template/alu_4_bit/alu_4_bit.v*

Do not changed the names of the output ports or the module name for your top file.

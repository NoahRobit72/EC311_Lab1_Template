# Lab 1: Design 4-bit binary Adder-Subtractor and ALU
## Due Date: Due by October 14, 2022

Please submit the lab on time and in the format mentioned below.

## Submission instructions
There are two main parts in lab-1: 1) Designing a 4-bit adder/subtractor; 2) Designing a 4-bit ALU.

### Folders Structure
Make the following 2 folders in the main folder ("EC311_Lab1_Template") using these exact names within the quotation marks, without any spaces:
  - (1) "add_sub_4_bit"
  - (2) "alu_4_bit"
  
You will place the solution code for part-1 of lab-1, the 4-bit binary adder-subtractor in the folder named "add_sub_4_bit", and the solution code for part-2 of lab-1, the 4-bit Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU), will be placed in the folder named "alu_4_bit".

### Lab-1 Part-1 Folder Structure & Signal Naming
The main code file for the part-1 of lab-1 should be inside the folder EC311_Lab1_Template/add_sub_4_bit (path of the folder) and the name of the file should be "add_sub_4_bit.v" and inside add_sub_4_bit.v the name of the module should also be "add_sub_4_bit" (i.e., it should be instantiated as *module add_sub_4_bit*)
